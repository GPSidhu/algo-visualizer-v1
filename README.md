## Algorithm Vizualizer

An attempt to understand the flow of algorithms and track all those variables
involved visually.

1. Understanding Manacher's Algo

This is a simple page setup to understand the flow of Manacher's Algorithm
for finding longest palindromic substring

In computer science, the longest palindromic substring or
longest symmetric factor problem is the problem of finding a
maximum-length contiguous substring of a given string that is
also a palindrome. For example, the longest palindromic
substring of "bananas" is "anana". (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring)

Right now it has only single page for below algo.
Expect to have more such algos added in the upcoming future.
